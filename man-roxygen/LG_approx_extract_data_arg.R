#' @param LG_approx_extract_data The list created when
#'     \code{LG_approx_extract} is used upon the Local Gaussian
#'     Approximations, i.e. the restricted subset of data needed for
#'     the computation of the local Gaussian spectra.  The list does
#'     also specify what kind of Local Gaussian Spectral Densities
#'     that should be created i.e. if it should be based on those from
#'     one ore five parameters.
