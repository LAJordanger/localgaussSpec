#' @param boot_type This one can be used to select what kind of
#'     bootstrap-algorithm to be used.  Default value \code{"block"},
#'     but it has not been implemented any other algorithms
#'     yet... (Reminder: It would be be nice to include the
#'     'network-duality' approach in this context -- but then I fear I
#'     might need to implement that routine from scratch.)
