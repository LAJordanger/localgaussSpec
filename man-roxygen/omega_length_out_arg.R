#' @param omega_length_out The number of values we want to consider in
#'     the interval from 0 to 1/2, that then will be multiplied with
#'     \code{2*pi} in the computation. Reminder: We have an even
#'     function, so the part from -1/2 to 0 are not computed.)  Note
#'     that this argument will be ignored when \code{omega_vec} is
#'     specified.  Default value \code{2^6}.
