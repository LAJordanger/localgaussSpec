#' @param LG_points An array that specifies the point at which it is
#'     desired to compute the local Gaussian estimates.  The default
#'     value \code{NULL} will imply that the values used in the
#'     computations upon the original data are recycled.  Values can
#'     alternatively be computed by the help of the function
#'     \code{LG_select_points}, but these must then be a subset of the
#'     original values.
