The scripts contained in this package can be used to reproduce the examples and figures seen in the two papers P1="Nonlinear spectral analysis: A local Gaussian approach" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02166) and P2="Nonlinear cross-spectrum analysis via the local Gaussian correlation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02495), which respectively deals with univariate and multivariate time series.  These two papers builds upon Paper 1 and Paper 2 in the PhD-dissertation "Nonlinear Spectrum Analysis based on the Local Gaussian Correlation and Model Selection for Copulas" (https://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/16950).

Note that these scripts also are intended to be used as templates for those that would like to investigate their own time series by means of the local Gaussian spectral densities.

Use the function "LG_extract_scripts" to extract these scripts.

Some practical details: The main folders "U" and "M" respectively contains content related to the univariate and multivariate examples.  Each of these main folders contains sub-folders named according to the principle "<paper-key>_<fig_ref>", where "<paper_key>" refers to either "P1" or "P2" as defined above, whereas "<fig_ref>" refers to the label of a figure in the paper specified by "<paper_key>".  All the sub-folders will contain a file called "1_Info.txt", which gives a short introduction.  In most cases, the subfolder will also contain the files "2_Data.R", "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R", where "2_Data.R" contains the code needed to compute the required local Gaussian correlations, where "3_Shiny.R" contains a few lines of code that can be used to start the integrated shiny-application directly (given that the data has been computed first) and where "4_Plot.R" contains the code needed in order to create the specified figure in the paper.  Note that there are a few cases that deviates from this setup, read the local "1_Info.txt"-file to see the relevant details.  In some cases there might also be some extra-files in the subfolders, which might be included since it is mentioned in a paper that extra scripts should be available in this package.

Both "U" and "M" contain a file called "Overview.txt", which gives a brief summary of the content of the different subfolders.

Note that the content of the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" will contain filenames that are based on the result from "2_Data.R", i.e. a part of the names is based on the digest-function being used on the time series under investigation.  For simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should then be the same name that occurs every time the script is used.  It is alas not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that a manual revision might be required in these two files.
