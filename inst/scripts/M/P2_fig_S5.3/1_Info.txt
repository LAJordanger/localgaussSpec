This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure S5.3 in the paper P2="Local Gaussian Cross-Spectrum Analysis" (publised in Econometrics, https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics11020012).

This plot combines an investigation of the EuStockMarkets-data, see P2_fig_09, with the result from the cGARCH-example (fitted to the EuStockMarkets-data) from P2_fig_11.  The coded needed for the estimation of the required local Gaussian cross-correlations is contained in the "2_Data.R" files in the folders P2_fig_09 and P2_fig_11, and there is thus no "2_Data.R"-file in this folder.  And similarly there is thus neither any "3_Shiny.R"-file in this folder.  This plot focus on the comparison between the the marginals (of the original data-set and the model fitted to it), based on the local Gaussian Co-spectrum.  See P2_fig_S5.4, P2_fig_S5.5 and P2_fig_S5.6 for similar comparisons based on the Quad-, Amplitude- and Phase-spectra.  See P2_fig_S5.1 and P2_fig_S5.2 for plots focusing only in the individual marginals.

The file "4_Plot.R" contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure S5.3 in paper P2.  This script will for the specified tuning parameters create the desired plots, adjust them (e.g. having the same scale on all the plots), and then collect the plots in a file that is saved to disk.  Note that "4_Plot.R" is also used for the production of figure S5.4, S5.5 and S5.6 (see explanation in file).

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
