This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure S3.7 in the paper P2="Local Gaussian Cross-Spectrum Analysis" (publised in Econometrics, https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics11020012).

This is a distance-based plot that compares (as the bandwidth varies) the three points corresponding to the 10%, 50% and 90% percentiles of the standard normal distribution.  This investigates the DAX- and CAC-components of the log-returns of the EuStockMarkets-data.  (The EuStockMarkets contains 1860 daily closing prices collected in the period 1991-1998, from the following four major European stock indices: Germany DAX (Ibis), Switzerland SMI, France CAC, and UK FTSE.  The data was sampled in business time, i.e., weekends and holidays were omitted.)

The reader might be a bit surprised that there is no other files in this folder, but the reason for this is that this particular plot is taken care of in the "4_Plot.R"-file that belongs to P2_fig_S3.6.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
