This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure S6.5 in the paper P2="Local Gaussian Cross-Spectrum Analysis" (publised in Econometrics, https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics11020012).

This is a heatmap-based plot with its corresponding distance based plot, that shows the effect on the estimated local Gaussian Amplitude- and Phase-spectra for diagonal points in the extreme lower tail.  This investigates the DAX- and CAC-components of the log-returns of the EuStockMarkets-data.  (The EuStockMarkets contains 1860 daily closing prices collected in the period 1991-1998, from the following four major European stock indices: Germany DAX (Ibis), Switzerland SMI, France CAC, and UK FTSE.  The data was sampled in business time, i.e., weekends and holidays were omitted.)

Note that P2_fig_S6.4, and P2_fig_S6.6 are based on based on the same data.  The heatmaps for the Co- and Quad-spectra are given in P2_fig_S6.4, whereas P2_fig_S6.6 gives a heatmap-based investigation of the local Gaussian cross-correlations.

The coded needed for the estimation of the required local Gaussian cross-correlations is contained in the "2_Data.R" files in the folder P2_fig_S6.4, and there is thus no "2_Data.R"-file in this folder.  And similarly there is thus neither any "3_Shiny.R"-file in this folder.

The reader might be a bit surprised that there is no other files in this folder, but the reason for this is that this particular plot is taken care of in the "4_Plot.R"-file that belongs to P2_fig_S6.4.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
