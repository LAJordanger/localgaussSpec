This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure S5.2 in the paper P2="Local Gaussian Cross-Spectrum Analysis" (publised in Econometrics, https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics11020012).

This plot combines an investigation of the EuStockMarkets-data, see P2_fig_09, with the result from the cGARCH-example (fitted to the EuStockMarkets-data) from P2_fig_11.  The coded needed for the estimation of the required local Gaussian cross-correlations is contained in the "2_Data.R" files in the folders P2_fig_09 and P2_fig_11, and there is thus no "2_Data.R"-file in this folder.  And similarly there is thus neither any "3_Shiny.R"-file in this folder.  This plot focus on the comparison of the marginals (for the original data-set and the model fitted to it).  See P2_fig_S5.3, P2_fig_S5.4, P2_fig_S5.5 and P2_fig_S5.6 for the comparisons between the marginals.

The reader might be a bit surprised that there is no other files in this folder, but the reason for this is that this particular plot is taken care of in the "4_Plot.R"-file that belongs to P2_fig_S5.1.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
