This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure F1 in the paper P1="Nonlinear spectral analysis: A local Gaussian approach" (published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.1840991, see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02166).

This plot combines an investigation of the dmbp-data, see P1_fig_09, with the result from the apARCH(2,3)-example (fitted to the dmbp-data) from P1_fig_11.  The coded needed for the estimation of the required local Gaussian autocorrelations is contained in the "2_Data.R" files in the folders P1_fig_09 and P1_fig_11, and there is thus no "2_Data.R"-file in this folder.  And similarly there is thus neither any "3_Shiny.R"-file in this folder.

The file "4_Plot.R" contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure F1 in paper P1.  This script will for the specified tuning parameters create the desired plots, adjust them (e.g. having the same scale on all the plots), and then collect the plots in a file that is saved to disk.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
