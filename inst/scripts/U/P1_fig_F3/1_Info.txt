This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure F3 in the paper P1="Nonlinear spectral analysis: A local Gaussian approach" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02166).

This investigates the dmbp-data, i.e. the "Deutschemark/British pound Exchange Rate" that was used by Bollerslev, and Ghysels in their paper "Periodic Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity", 1996, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, *14*, 139-151.  The data-set used here has been copied from the version used in the rugarch-package (Alexios Ghalanos, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rugarch), since a user might like to test this script without having to install that package first.

The purpose of this plot is to investigate how the block length L (from the adjusted block bootstrap given in P1) affects the estimated pointwise confidence intervals.  This investigation uses the same data as those computed in P1_fig_F3, so see there for the relevant files "2_Data" and "3_Shiny".  See P1_fig_F4 for a similar investigation based on a single sample from the "local trigonometric"-example.

The file "4_Plot.R" contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure F3 in paper P1.  This script will for the specified tuning parameters create the desired plots, adjust them (e.g. having the same scale on all the plots), and then collect the plots in a file that is saved to disk.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
