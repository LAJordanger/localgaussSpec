This folder contains the code needed for the reproduction of figure D7 in the paper P1="Nonlinear spectral analysis: A local Gaussian approach" (published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.1840991, see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02166).

This is a distance-based plot that compares (as the bandwidth varies) the three points corresponding to the 10%, 50% and 90% percentiles of the standard normal distribution.  This investigates the dmbp-data, i.e. the "Deutschemark/British pound Exchange Rate" that was used by Bollerslev, and Ghysels in their paper "Periodic Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity", 1996, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, *14*, 139-151.  The data-set used here has been copied from the version used in the rugarch-package (Alexios Ghalanos, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rugarch), since a user might like to test this script without having to install that package first.

The reader might be a bit surprised that there is no other files in this folder, but the reason for this is that this particular plot is taken care of in the "4_Plot.R"-file that belongs to P1_fig_D5.

NOTE: It is intended that this script can be used as a template for similar investigations.  The interested reader should then be aware of the fact that the code in "2_Data.R" creates a folder with a name that depends on the investigated example, and the name of this folder is needed in the files "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R".  The present folder-reference in "3_Shiny.R" and "4_Plot.R" is based on the result from "2_Data.R" when it was tested by the developer, and for simulated time series (based on a given seed to the random number generator), it should be the same result that occurs every time the script is used.  It is however not possible to guarantee that the exact same result will occur across different operative systems (or different versions of R), so it might thus happen that some users must perform a minor revision due to this.  This task requires an update of one line of code in the beginning of the respective files.
